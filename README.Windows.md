# The Mozart Programming System
is an open source implementation of the programming language Oz 3.

Oz is a multi-paradigm language that supports declarative programming, object-oriented programming, constraint programming, concurrency and distributed programming as part of a coherent whole

# Mozart2 binary download

A recent mozart2 binary can be obtained at [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mozart-oz/?source=directory).

# Setup a build environment on Windows

## Required software

Download and install the following tools:

*   TortoiseSVN and TortoiseGit.
*   The [MinGW distro](http://nuwen.net/mingw.html) of nuwen.net.
*   CMake.
*   Emacs.
*   [TCL](http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads)
*   Boost

Checkout GTest as explained in the main Readme. For LLVM, use version 3.2,
which is in RC3 as of this writing.

We will assume that MinGW is installed in the directory `C:\MinGW`. This is
not a requirement. Just make sure to adapt the paths that we give in this
readme.

## Global configuration

## Suggested directory layout

We suggest that you use the following directory layout, starting from a
directory `<projects>` where you store your projects:

```
<projects>
  + mozart2              // cloned from this repo
  + externals
      + gtest            // source of GTest (see below)
      + llvm             // source of LLVM (see below)
  + builds               // root for your builds
      + gtest-debug      // debug build of GTest
      + llvm-release     // release build of LLVM
      + mozart2-debug    // debug build of Mozart
      + mozart2-release  // release build of Mozart
```

Put the following directories in your PATH:

*    `C:\MinGW\bin`
*    `<cmake>\bin`
*    `<emacs>\bin`
*    `<projects>\builds\llvm-release\bin`

Patch the file C:\MinGW\include\c++\4.7.2\i686-pc-mingw32\bits\c++config.h by
replacing

    /* Define if __float128 is supported on this host. */
    #define _GLIBCXX_USE_FLOAT128 1

by

    /* Define if __float128 is supported on this host. */
    #ifndef __clang__
    #define _GLIBCXX_USE_FLOAT128 1
    #endif

##Download GTest and LLVM
    externals> svn co http://googletest.googlecode.com/svn/trunk gtest
    externals> svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/tags/RELEASE_32/final llvm
    externals> cd llvm/tools
    externals/llvm/tools> svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/tags/RELEASE_32/final clang

## Configuration and build of GTest and LLVM

Configure and build GTest:

    gtest-debug>cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=C:/MinGW/bin/make.exe -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../../externals/gtest
    gtest-debug>make

Configure and build LLVM with:

    llvm-release>cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=C:/MinGW/bin/make.exe -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../../externals/llvm
    llvm-release>make

## Configuration and build of Mozart2

Configure and build Mozart with:

Make sure you opene your command prompt with administrator privileges

    mozart2-release>cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=C:/MinGW/bin/make.exe -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGTEST_SRC_DIR=../../externals/gtest -DGTEST_BUILD_DIR=../gtest-debug -DLLVM_SRC_DIR=../../externals/llvm -DLLVM_BUILD_DIR=../llvm-release ../../mozart2
    mozart2-release>make
    mozart2-release>make install

The binaries should be installed in your C:\Program Files\Mozart\bin folder.

If the script does not detect correctly where MinGW is installed, you can tell
it using the option `-DMINGW_ROOT=C:/Path/To/MinGW`. Similarly, if the version of GCC in your
MinGW is not 4.7.2, you can tell with `-DMINGW_COMPILER_VERSION=4.7.1`.
