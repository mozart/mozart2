0. About This Info.

   This help note is written for the first reading of a
novice Oz Browser User, although it can be used sometimes
as reference material. More precise and complete
information about Oz Browser can be found in the "DFKI Oz
User's Manual".

1. Getting Help.

   This brief description can be invoked via the 'ctl-h'
keyboard accelerator or via the 'Help' entry in the
'Browser' menu.

2. What is Oz Browser?

   Oz Browser is a an output tool for displaying possibly
partial information about the values of variables. Oz
Browser

o is simple: You do not need to learn much to use it.
o is concurrent: Incrementally imposed constraints are
     automatically visualized;
o is flexible: The user can select from a variety  of
     formats and options for convenient and efficient
     use;
o produces pretty output: Browser automatically
     chooses a concise and elegant representation of
     constraints;
o can be customized via the procedure 'setParameter',
     which is a member of the 'Browse' module;
o can be used as an embedded viewing tool in any Oz
     application.

3. What is browsed by Oz Browser?

   Oz Browser displays the current information about
values of variables. This information is stated by means
of constraints stored in constraint stores, called also
blackboards. Constraint which describes a value of a
variable is converted by Browser to a directed graph
which is shown in textual form.

   In the scope of the Oz Browser documentation, these
graphs are called 'terms', and their components are
called 'subterms'.

   Additionally, certain kinds of constraints are treated
specially; most essential of them are listed here:

o  Fixed length lists are considered by Oz Browser as
   compound values, for instance [1 2 3];
o  Chunks (i.e. objects, procedures and cells) are
   considered by Oz Browser as records with a special
   representation. They have appropriate labels, for
   instance <P/1 Test>. These records can be proper or
   not depending on whether they have adjoined components
   or not;
o  Oz Classes are records with special labels, like
   <C: UrObject>;
o  Finite domain variables have a special representation.
   For instance, if a FD variable is constrainted with
   the domain {1,2,3,7,8,9}, then it is shown as
   '_{ 1..3 7..10 }'.

   Generally, Oz Browser tries to represent information
browsed by it in the form syntactically acceptable by the
Oz Compiler. See the Reference Manual for complete
treatment of this topic.

4. Invoking Oz Browser.

   Browser can be invoked via the predefined procedure
'Browse/1', for instance

   {Browse 'Oz Browser is the right tool!'}

   Browser should be used normally in the top-level
computation space. Otherwise, browsing is not concurrent,
and there is a number of restrictions on its
functionality.

5. The Buffering mechanism.

   Every browsed term is stored in an internal FIFO
buffer.  The size of this buffer is bounded and can be
set via the 'Size' submenu of the 'Buffer' menu.

   By default, all terms from the buffer are shown
simultaneously in the text widget. This can be switched
off via the 'last' or 'first' entries of the 'Navigate'
menu, and switched back via the 'all' entry.

6. Redraw and Rebrowse.

   Browsed terms can be 'redraw'n or 'rebrowse'ed. The
difference between these operations is that in the first
case an internal representation of a term remains
unchanged, whereas in the second one Browser acts as
if new 'browse' commands were issued.

   The 'rebrowse' command should be used if a wrong
layout of the term was produced (due to a Browser or X11
server problem), and the 'redraw' command practically in
all other cases.

7. The Output Format.

   A subterm can be browsed completely, partially or it
can be shown in the form '...' ('shrunken'), depending on
the size of the term being browsed and the values of the
'Depth', 'Width' and 'Nodes' parameters. Values of these
parameters can be changed via the submenus of the 'View'
menu.

   The meaning of the 'Depth' and 'Width' parameters is
obvious; 'Nodes' limits the total number of subtrees in a
browsed term.

   Note that increasing of the 'Depth' or 'Width'
parameters automatically affects all actually shown
terms.

8. Stopping to browse.

   Browsing of a term can be stopped via the 'ctl-s'
keyboard accelerator or the 'Stop' entry of the 'Browser'
menu. It does nothing else as sets the 'Nodes' parameter
(from the 'View' menu) to zero, and means that every
subterm which is currently not yet shown comes out in the
shrunken form.

   Note that 'ctl-s' breaks generation of an internal
representation; the already produced part of it will be
used for viewing, that takes certain amount of time.

9. Navigating.

   Every (sub)term except primitive ones can be
'selected'.  This is achieved by clicking the left
button.  Unselection is performed by clicking the right
button. The last six operations from 'Navigate' menu can
be applied to suitable selected (sub)terms.

   The operations mentioned above can be invoked via
keyboard accelerators, which are shown on the right side
in the menus. Note that in this case a subterm does not
need to be selected. You only have to move the mouse
cursor to a term and hit the key.

   Additionally, the 'expand' command can be invoked via
a double-click of the left mouse button, and 'shrink' via
a double-click of the right one.

10. Coreferences and Cycles.

   Browser can find and specially represent common
subterms or cycles in a given term. In the first case, for
every new subterm to be shown, an equal one is searched
among already shown ones. If one was found, the new
subterm is represented in the form 'R<number>', meaning
'Reference number <number>'.  Simultaneously the 'old'
(found) one gets the prefix 'R<number>=' in its
representation.  Note that cycles are detected in this
case too.

   Searching for cycles is alike, but cycle names have
the form 'C<number>'. Of course, searching for cycles has
the lower computational complexity and should be
preferred if possible.

   Every reference can be 'dereferenced' via the 'deref'
command: Browser will make a term with the corresponding
prefix visible and select it.

   The 'deref' command can be also invoked via a
double-click of the middle mouse button.

11. The Output Options.

   There is also a number of modes which are controlled
via the 'View' menu. Some of them are probably not quite
obvious:

'Scrolling' controls the position of the visible fragment
   of the text widget. If this switch is on, then the
   last browsed term is always visible;

'Private fields' controls browsing of record subtrees
   under feature names which are (Oz) names. If this
   switch is off, a question mark is shown instead of
   these subtrees;

'Virtual strings' forces browsing of (Oz) virtual strings
   in their textual representation;

'Variables aligned' disables the placement of variables
   in one row; instead, they are shown in one column;

'Lists flat' switches on the special internal
   representation of cyclic and incomplete lists. This is
   much more efficient than a 'deep' one, but list
   constructors cannot be selected separately;

'Width inc' and 'Depth inc' stand for width and depth
   increments correspondingly, and determine how many
   subtrees are added to a term's representation when
   the 'expand' command is called;

12. Copy and Paste.

   X11 selecting works in Browser too, but you have to
click mouse buttons while pressing the 'shift' key. For
instance, 'shift-button1' means setting the selection
mark.
