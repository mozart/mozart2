Quick instructions for testing your mozart installation.

From <build-dir>/share/test:

  make boot-all   - Builds all tests with the compiler in <build-dir>
  make boot-check - Runs all tests (except dp) with the enulator in <build-dir>

You can also run oztest and ozbench with the oz from your path/OZ_HOME. Run

  oztest -h
  ozbench -h

for lots of options.
