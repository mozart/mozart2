% These tests create and distribute different entities.
% Each entity is inserted in a weak dictionary. After a number of
% applications, they are discarded locally and remotely. They are
% then expected to show on the gc-stream of the weak dictionary.

% Since the current implementation of the message passing layer
% will transport any messages at the next thread switch, {Delay 10} or
% suspension on an unbound variable is assumed to lead to transport of
% the message.
