<H1>Examples of Resolving Relative URLs, Part 3</H1>

This document has an embedded base URL of
<PRE>
   Content-Base: http://a/b/c/d;p=1/2?q
</PRE>
the relative URLs should be resolved as shown below.  For this test page,
I am particularly interested in testing whether "/" in parameters is or is not
treated as part of the path hierarchy.
<P>
I will need your help testing the examples on multiple browsers. 
What you need to do is point to the example anchor and compare it to the
resolved URL in your browser (most browsers have a feature by which you
can see the resolved URL at the bottom of the window/screen when the anchor
is active).

<H3>Synopsis</H3>

RFC 1808 specified that the "/" character within parameter information
does not affect the hierarchy within URL parsing.  It would appear that
it does in current practice.  This implies that the parameters should
be part of each path segment and not outside the path.  The URI draft has
been written accordingly.
