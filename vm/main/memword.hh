// A MemWord (memory word) is a type which is defined as having the size of a
// char* and behaving as the union of a number of other types. If they are
// small enough, they are actually stored in the MemWord. If not, they are
// stored as a pointer to external memory.

// The MWUnion type implements the MemWord by having a template pack of types
// to be made into a union.

// The MWUAccessor provides the getters/setters for the MWUnion.

// The MWTest is an helper class to deal with types which are bigger than a
// char*
